The New User Flow
Here is the revised task description for the "Animals" page, combining all the best ideas:
Layout: A two-column grid of cute, simple animal face icons at the bottom of the screen.
Selection: The user taps the "Cat" icon. It gets a bright border.
Initial State:
In the center of the screen, the word CAT appears in large, friendly, but faded letters.
To the right of the word, a cute illustration of a cat appears, also faded.
Below the word, two brightly colored buttons appear: a teal C button and an orange AT button.
Interaction:
The child taps the C button. It makes the /k/ sound, and the "C" in the central word blooms into full teal color.
The child taps the AT button. It makes the "at" sound, and the "AT" blooms into full orange color.
The Grand Reward: The moment the word is complete:
A joyful chime plays.
The app speaks the syllables ("C-AT") and then the full word ("Cat!").
The cat illustration blooms into full, vibrant color.
An audible "Meow!" plays.
Progression: The highlight border automatically moves to the next animal in the grid ("Dog"), inviting the child to continue their journey.
