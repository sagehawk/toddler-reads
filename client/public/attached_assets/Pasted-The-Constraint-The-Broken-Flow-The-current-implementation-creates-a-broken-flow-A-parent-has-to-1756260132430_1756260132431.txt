The Constraint: The Broken Flow
The current implementation creates a "broken flow." A parent has to:
Select the _at (Word Stem) from the dropdown.
Practice it.
Go back to the dropdown.
Select the -at Family.
Then start blending.
This is too much effort and sacrifice. It breaks the learning momentum. We will fix this by creating a single, seamless "scaffolding" experience.
The Solution: The "Integrated Stem"
The word stem will now be the foundational, first step within each CVC module.
V2.1 Development Instructions: The Integrated Stem & Final UX Polish
Primary Goal: To create a seamless, intuitive learning flow for the CVC modules by integrating the word stem directly into the letter tray. This will transform the feature from a series of disjointed actions into a single, guided learning experience.
1. Dropdown Menu Refinement
Task: Remove the "Word Stem" entries from the main dropdown menu.
Instruction: The dropdown for "First Words (CVC)" should only contain the word families (e.g., "-at Family," "-et Family," "-it Family"). Selecting a family will trigger the new, integrated learning flow.
2. CVC Module UI & Functional Overhaul
This is the core of the update.
Implement the "Stem Button":
Task: When a parent selects a word family (e.g., "-at Family"), the horizontal "Magic Letter Tray" should now have a new button as the very first option on the far left: a simple underscore (_).
Instruction: This _ button represents the word stem. It should have a neutral, distinct color (like a soft gray) to differentiate it from the consonant buttons.
Default State on Load:
Task: When the CVC module loads, it must default to the word stem.
Instruction: The main card should display _at, and the _ button in the tray should be highlighted as the active selection. The audio for "at" should play automatically one time to introduce the core sound for the session.
Interaction Logic:
Tapping the _ Button: Plays the sound of the word stem (e.g., "at"). The main card displays _at.
Tapping a Consonant Button (e.g., "B"):
The main card updates to display the full word ("Bat").
The initial consonant ("B") should be rendered in its unique color. The word stem ("at") should be in the standard black/charcoal. This visually reinforces the blending concept.
The audio plays the blended sound: "b... at... Bat."
Arrow Key Navigation:
Instruction: The left/right arrow keys should now cycle through all the buttons in the tray, including the _ button. This allows the parent to seamlessly move between practicing the stem and practicing the blended words.
3. Final Visual Polish
Font Weight: As previously discussed, ensure the main letter/word on the card uses a heavier font weight (semi-bold or bold) for maximum clarity and visual presence.
The New User Journey (Example: "-at Family")
Parent selects "-at Family" from the main dropdown.
The screen loads. The main card shows _at. The app says "at." The letter tray below shows _, B, C, F, H... with the _ button highlighted.
The parent drills the "at" sound a few times by tapping the _ button.
They then tap the colored "B" button. The card changes to show a colored "B" and a black "at." The app says "b... at... Bat."
They use the right arrow key to move to the next letter, "C." The card changes to a colored "C" and a black "at." The app says "c... at... Cat."
To review the core sound, they can tap the _ button at any time.
This revised flow is intuitive, powerful, and aligns perfectly with how a child learns. It's a premium experience that justifies the price.
