                      I struggled with reading my entire childhood. While other kids effortlessly decoded words, I felt lost and frustrated. The shame of being called on to read aloud in class still haunts me today.
                    </p>

                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    As an adult, I learned that I had missed critical phonemic awareness skills that most children develop naturally between ages 2-4. By the time formal reading instruction began in kindergarten, I was already behind‚Äîand I never caught up.
                  </p>

                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    When my son was born, I made a promise: he would never experience the shame and frustration I felt. I researched everything I could about early reading development and discovered the crucial importance of phonics instruction during the toddler years.
                  </p>

                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    But when I looked for tools to help teach my 20-month-old son, I found nothing but flashy games, distracting cartoons, and apps that prioritized entertainment over education. I knew there had to be a better way.
                  </p>

                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    That's when I decided to build ToddlerReads‚Äîa simple, focused, parent-led system that gives toddlers the phonemic awareness foundation they need to become confident readers. No distractions, no guilt, just pure learning in 5 minutes a day.
                  </p>

                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed font-medium text-foreground">
                    Today, my son reads confidently and joyfully. And now, I want to give your child that same gift‚Äîthe gift of a strong start that will serve them for life.
