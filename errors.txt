That error usually happens because your build tool (likely Vite, Rollup, or something wrapped by Vercel) is trying to use index.html as the entry point but canâ€™t find it.

Here are some common causes and fixes:

âœ… Things to check

Does index.html exist at the project root?

Vite and Rollup expect an index.html in the root folder (not inside src/).

If yours is inside src/, move it to the root, or adjust config.

Check your vite.config.js or rollup.config.js

You may have an incorrect root or input path.
Example for Vite:

export default defineConfig({
  root: ".",
  build: {
    rollupOptions: {
      input: "index.html",
    },
  },
});


If your index.html is in src/, change root: "src".

Wrong build command in Vercel

Vercel defaults to npm run build, but if youâ€™re using Vite, make sure your package.json has:

"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "vite build",
  "preview": "vite preview"
}


If youâ€™re using React with CRA, it should be:

"build": "react-scripts build"


Check vercel.json or project settings

If you set "outputDirectory", it must match your actual build output folder (dist, build, etc.).

ðŸ”§ Quick Fix Steps

Ensure index.html is in the right place.

Update your build script in package.json.

If using Vite, confirm vite.config.js has the correct root and input.

Re-deploy after cleaning dependencies:

rm -rf node_modules
npm install
