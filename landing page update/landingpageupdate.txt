Landing Page Development Prompt for "ToddlerReads"
Project Goal: To create a single, high-converting landing page for toddlerreads.com modeled after the provided "Jive" example, but fully customized for the ToddlerReads brand and offer. The page must build trust, communicate the unique value proposition, and drive visitors to start a 7-day free trial.
1. Global Design & Aesthetic
Vibe: The page should feel warm, premium, trustworthy, and Montessori-inspired. It must be clean, spacious, and calming. Avoid any loud or distracting elements.
Typography: Use the Nunito font family for all text.
Color Palette: Use the established brand colors:
Primary Action Color (Buttons): Soft Teal (#4FD1C5)
Text & Accents: Dark Charcoal Gray (#2D3748)
Background: Soft Off-White (#FFFAF0)
Unique Visual Element: Instead of the abstract squiggles in the example, the background should feature large, soft-colored letters from our brand palette (A, B, C, etc.). They should be subtly placed in the corners and margins, angled gently inwards to guide the eye towards the central content.

Important Notes for the Developer:
Conditional Redirect: If a user visits toddlerreads.com and has an active login session (check localStorage), they should be redirected directly to the app's main learning screen, bypassing the landing page. All other traffic goes to the landing page.
Responsive Design: All elements must be fully responsive and optimized for a seamless mobile experience.
Performance: The page must load incredibly fast. Optimize all images and use clean code.
This plan gives you a complete, strategically sound landing page. It takes the proven structure of a successful SaaS site and infuses it with your unique story, brand, and value proposition. This is how you convert traffic into trials.
