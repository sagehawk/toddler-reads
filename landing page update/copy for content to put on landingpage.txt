[Testimonial Section]
[Testimonial 1 - Placeholder]
Image: A happy parent & child.
Name: Jessica M.
Text: "I was honestly shocked. Within a week, my 22-month-old was pointing to letters and making the right sounds. We do our 'letter time' every morning now, and he loves it. This is the first app that doesn't feel like a guilty distraction."
[Testimonial 2 - Placeholder]
Image: Another happy parent & child.
Name: David R.
Text: "The best part is the simplicity. No confusing games or characters, just pure, focused learning. My son's preschool teacher asked what we were doing at home because his phonemic awareness is so far ahead of his peers. Worth every penny."
[Testimonial 3 - Placeholder]
Image: Another happy parent & child.
Name: Sarah P.
Text: "As a mom who struggled with reading as a kid, finding ToddlerReads felt like a gift. The founder's story hit home, and the app delivered. It's calm, effective, and something we both enjoy doing together."
