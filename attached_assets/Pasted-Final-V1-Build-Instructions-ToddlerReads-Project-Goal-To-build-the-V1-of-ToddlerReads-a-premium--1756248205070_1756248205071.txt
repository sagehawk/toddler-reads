Final V1 Build Instructions: ToddlerReads
Project Goal: To build the V1 of ToddlerReads, a premium, parent-led phonics system for toddlers. The design must be minimalist, warm, and completely distraction-free, focusing entirely on the core learning loop.
1. Branding & Visual Identity (Global Changes)
Logo Integration: Replace all placeholder logos with the official "Sprout" ToddlerReads logo.
Color Palette: The entire app should use the warm, organic color palette.
Primary Action Color (e.g., selected letter in tray): Soft Teal (#4FD1C5)
Background: Soft Off-White (#FFFAF0)
Primary Text: Dark Charcoal Gray (#2D3748)
Typography: The font must be changed across the entire application to Poppins. It is clean, rounded, and highly legible for early learners without being "childish."
2. The Main Screen (Formerly "Setup Screen")
Action: Simplify this screen to a single point of entry.
Instructions:
Remove the "Learning Mode" selection card. The app will only have one mode for V1: Drill Mode.
The "Start Learning Session" button should be the primary call to action. When clicked, it will take the user directly to the Drill Screen with the "Full Alphabet" deck pre-selected.
The "My Story" link remains a crucial element at the bottom.
3. The Drill Screen (The Core Experience)
This is the most important screen. The focus is on a calm, controlled, and effective learning environment.
Task 1: Implement "Bigger, Colorful Letters"
Bigger: The main letter card should be the dominant visual element, occupying at least 40-50% of the viewport height. It needs to be the undeniable focus for a toddler.
Colorful: Each letter of the alphabet will be assigned a specific, consistent color from a pre-defined, soft, and harmonious palette (inspired by high-end wooden alphabet blocks). Do not randomize the colors. "A" should always be the same color, "B" should always be its own color, etc. This creates visual interest and aids in memory recall without being distracting.
Task 2: Finalize Navigation & Interaction
The "Magic Letter Tray" is the primary navigation. It should be visible by default.
Remove all on-screen text related to "Arrow Keys." All navigation is driven by tap/click on the letter tray.
The "Hide Magic Letter Tray" button should smoothly animate the tray out of view to create a "Focus Mode." The button should then change to "Show Magic Letter Tray."
The audio for each letter's sound must only play on-tap/click of the large letter card.
Remove the pagination dots entirely. They are redundant and add visual clutter.
4. Scoping The "First Words" Module (For V1.1 - The First Upsell)
The CVC word functionality is the logical next step and will be our first paid expansion pack. The V1 architecture must be planned to accommodate this seamlessly.
Feature Name: First Words
User Experience:
This will be a new "Deck" that a user can select.
The UI will present two distinct cards: the onset (first letter, e.g., 'C') and the rime (the word family, e.g., 'at').
Tapping the C card will cycle through other consonants (B, H, F, etc.). Tapping the at card will cycle through other word families (-an, -ig, -op, etc.).
The audio logic is crucial: Tapping "C" plays the "kuh" sound. Tapping "at" plays the "at" sound. A final, automatic audio plays the fully blended word: "Cat."
Developer Instruction: Please design the data structure (phonicsDecks.json) to be extensible. It should handle the current "Full Alphabet" deck and be able to easily incorporate "Word Family" decks in the future without a major refactor.
