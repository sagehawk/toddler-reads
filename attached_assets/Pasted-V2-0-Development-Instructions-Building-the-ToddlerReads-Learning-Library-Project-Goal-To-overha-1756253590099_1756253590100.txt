V2.0 Development Instructions: Building the "ToddlerReads Learning Library"
Project Goal: To overhaul the application's UI/UX into a premium, multi-module learning platform. The V1 launch will focus on a flawless "Letters" module and a functional "CVC Words" module, establishing the foundation for future expansion.
Phase 1: The Foundational Redesign (The New Chassis)
This addresses all of your immediate UI/UX feedback.
Centralized, Immersive Layout:
Task: Redesign the learning screen. The central card displaying the letter/word should be significantly larger, taking up the majority of the screen's focus. The overall feeling should be more immersive and less cluttered.
Typography & Color:
Task: Change the font across the entire application to Nunito.
Task: When a letter is displayed (e.g., 'A'), it should be colored with the same soft, engaging color from its corresponding button in the letter tray. This creates a cohesive and beautiful visual link.
Navigation Overhaul - The "Learning Module Dropdown":
Task: Replace the "Magic Letter Tray" with a more sophisticated, cleaner dropdown menu system. The button to trigger this could simply be the name of the current deck (e.g., "Full Alphabet") or an icon.
Functionality: When tapped, this dropdown will be the central navigation for the entire app. It will contain:
Module 1: Letters (with "Full Alphabet" as the only V1 option)
Module 2: First Words (CVC) (with sub-options like "-at Family," "-et Family," etc.)
Future modules (Sight Words, Numbers) will be added here.
Phase 2: Building the Core Learning Modules
Module 1: Letters (Refined)
Task: This is the default module. It should function as we've refined: a parent taps a letter in the tray (now part of the new dropdown UI), and the large, colored letter appears and the sound plays instantly.
Keyboard Navigation: Implement left/right arrow key functionality to cycle through the letters sequentially.
Module 2: First Words (CVC - The First Upsell)
Task: Build the logic for the CVC word blending.
User Story: A parent selects the "-at Family" from the "First Words" section of the new dropdown.
The main display shows _at.
The letter tray below is now populated only with the relevant consonants (B, C, F, H, M, P, R, S).
Tapping "C" in the tray forms "Cat" on the main display and triggers the audio: "c... at... Cat."
The parent can use the arrow keys or on-screen arrows to cycle through the consonants (Bat -> Cat -> Fat...).
Phase 3: The Future Roadmap & Story Integration
The "My Story" Button:
This button should remain prominent on the main learning screen, likely in the top-left corner. It is your most powerful conversion tool and must be easily accessible.
The Big List - Future Expansion Packs:
Your list of future content is your product roadmap. For now, it's a list. But in your marketing and on your website, you can tease it: "Start with Letters and First Words today, with modules on Sight Words, Numbers, and Simple Sentences coming soon for all subscribers." This signals immense future value and justifies the subscription. 【$100M_Offers_How_To_Make_Offers_So_Good_People_Feel_Stupid_Saying_No.pdf†Enhancing The Offer: Bonuses†L159-L167】
Final Instructions for The Developer:
Global UI Overhaul:
Implement the "Nunito" font throughout the app.
Redesign the main learning screen to feature a larger, centered content card.
Replace the persistent letter tray with a master dropdown menu that will house all learning modules.
"Letters" Module:
Ensure tapping a letter in the tray changes the main letter's content and color, and triggers the audio simultaneously.
Enable left/right arrow key navigation.
Add the "ToddlerReads" logo to this screen.
"First Words (CVC)" Module:
Build the functionality to select a word family (start with -at).
The UI should display the word stem (_at) and a tray of only the relevant consonants.
Tapping a consonant should complete the word and play the blended sound.
Enable arrow key navigation through the consonants.
Story Integration:
Ensure the "My Story" button is present on the main screen.
This is a significant but necessary evolution. You are now building a platform, not just a feature. This is what a premium, high-LTV product looks like. This is something parents will not only pay for but will be afraid to leave because of the value you continuously add.
